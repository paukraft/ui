        <p>
          I&apos;m a fullstack web developer based in Germany. My expertise lies
          deep within the Next.js ecosystem, where I build digital experiences
          that bridge functionality and user experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          While I primarily identify as a developer, I&apos;ve cultivated an eye
          for UI designâ€”creating interfaces that are both functional and
          aesthetically pleasing. Though I wouldn&apos;t call myself a designer,
          I understand the principles that make digital products feel right.
        </p>
        <p>
          My curiosity extends beyond code. I&apos;m fascinated by everything
          tech and science, always eager to explore new technologies and
          understand how things work at their core.
